Versions:

	10-02-04 - 2.4 ( Bug Fixes, Changes )
		- The crash bug should now be fixed
		- Fixed up NewOpts screen. Before it wasn't showing any other
		  NewOpts pages you might have had loaded.
		- Added more protections against sending images to your top,
		  bottom, and center print messages. Some images cause tribes
		  to crash, and considering they are unnecessary to play, I just
		  assume limit them completly. Now all images are replaced 
		  automatically with [Removed]
		- Added two sounds to the pack for my counter. The counter now
		  plays two sounds apon a kill and headshot. I personally like
		  them, but they are capable of being disabled just the same.
		- Added NewOpts pages for the following items:

			Acronyms Manager
			Friends List
			General Preferences
			HUD Positions/Sizes
			Settings

		- Added a check on the time hud. Now if you are not running the
		  last hope patch, "Bad Ver" will display in white letters. If
		  you need the patch, it can be located at www.lasthope.us
		- Changed the variable names of some HUDS and preferences. I'd
		  advise a fresh install, but isn't neccesary.
		- Changed Paintball Counter; Now it shows only values that are needed.
		  Example: You Killed 5 people (2 are headshots), cap once, and return
		  twice, you'll see:

			Last round stats - Kills: 3; Headshots: 2; Captures: 1; Returns: 2; Total kills: 5

		  Now, if you didn't capture, or return, or get any headshots, you'd
		  only see:

			Last round stats - Kills: 3; Total Kills: 8

		- Removed the Bot Commands "Include Self" variable to the file the
		  handles the bot commands. user's don't need to fool with it, and
		  scripters would be farmiliar with it.
		- Cleaned up some memory by deleting variables that are unnecessary
		  (thnx cosine ;d) post-startup.
		- Fixed eventInventoryText (forgot the event line in file).
		- Fixed auto-sad toggle. Now you can toggle it on and off and have
		  it work. Previously, if you started tribes with AutoSAD enabled, then
		  went to the NewOpts screen and disabled it, it wouldn't disable.
		- Added !remsad command to remove a sad password on a server.

		Known Bugs:
		- Can't run game in windowed mode; must play in full screen.

	06-09-04 - 2.3 ( More Stuff )
		- Added new event

			eventTime

		- Fixed (again) the prefs file not applying settings when you
		  change them in KingPrefs.skip.cs (Thanks Villman)
		- Added red force fields to pack
		- Added NewOpts page into the config section fo tribes. Now you
		  can change settings from within tribes. Note that some settings
		  require a restart of tribes to take effect.
		- Updated vote hud to work with canceled votes on Paintball v2.6.x
		  (My mod)
		- Updated Acronyms List. Added tk, sk, hm, kt, and kt.org
		- Included paintball scripts

			Counter
			Counter HUD
			Kill Counter
			Kill Mission Area

		  Please see each file seperatly (in paintball folder) for settings
		  and information.
		- Forgot eventTime event. Added to events list.
		- With recent update to 1.14b, and the ability to use a timestamp,
		  times hud has been added.
		- Removed non-paintball scripts and HUDs. Should improve performance,
		  and hog less of your screen.
		- Changed acronyms a little. Add your favorites to the bottom of the
		  Acronyms.sys.cs file now, and they will be automatically added.

	02-13-04 - 2.2 ( Added Features )

		- Added !acronym command to control different features of the
		  replacer.

			!acronym <on/off/style> [new_style]

		- Fixed Pilot mode not enabling
		- Added a few new events that can trigger scripts

			eventBottomPrint
			eventModInfo
			eventVote
			eventNewMenu
			eventAddMenuItem
			eventInfoLine

		- Added nude panels (off by default; see KingPrefs file)
		- Added no enter inventory setting to my config
		- Added $Script::MinVersion variable to script files.
		  When present in a file being loaded, the minimum version
		  is compared to the current. If the check fails, a warning
		  is displayed on screen in the console.
		- Fixed bug with friends list. Taking a user off list
		  wouldn't actually remove them.

	01-23-04 - 2.1 ( Added Features )

		- Fixed how the script ignores changed to the KingPrefs.skip.cs file
		  after the initial installation. Changes in the Prefs file should
		  now immediatly take effect.
		- Fixed VoteHUD in that it wouldn't catch vote cancellations in some
		  instances.
		- Fixed a bug in the protection system
		- Added Quotes System (Official Release), type !quote in game
		- Added a little thing to have it type in the SAD for a server
		  when you add it to the AutoSAD Script. (Thanks Dark)
		- Fixed AutoSAD
		- Added it so that when you set your sad password for a server,
		  you also login.
		- Added Friends List (Read README.TXT for more info)

	01-17-04 - 2.01 ( Minor Bug Fixes, New Features )

		- Fixed the inability to move the Vote HUD.
		- Fixed a problem with the DuelHud daving to three different
		  files, and also saving mass amounts of information. Please
		  delete the files DuelCount.cs, King_King_DuelCount.cs and
		  King_DuelCount.cs files in your config directory if they exist.
		- Added the ability to turn off and change the acronyms. I have
		  plans to change how acronyms are added and removed, but have
		  not gotten to it yet. I should have it done by the next release.
		- Added a toggle for the console logging. Logging is disabled by
		  default now, but may have already caused some large logs.

	01-10-04 - 2.0 ( Script Release Date )

		- Send all bugs and suggestions to me, my contacts are
		  listed at the bottom.
